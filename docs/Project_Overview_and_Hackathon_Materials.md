- **Community-Driven Ecosystem**: Integration with other fitness apps in the Imperfect Fitness Ecosystem.

A cross-chain fitness application with AI-enhanced workout analysis, it leverages multiple Chainlink services for weather-enhanced scoring, automated challenges, and cross-chain fitness verification.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router for frontend development.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type-safe development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with a custom Bauhaus-Brutalist design system.
- **MediaPipe**: Google's ML solution for real-time pose detection.
- **Ethers.js**: For blockchain interactions.
- **Avalanche C-Chain**: Fast, low-cost blockchain for the leaderboard.
- **Chainlink Functions**: Decentralized off-chain computation for AI analysis.

### Key Components

- **`ImprovedWorkoutTracker.tsx`**: Main workout interface for camera integration, pose detection, and session management.
- **`pose-detection.ts`**: Core logic for MediaPipe integration, angle calculations, and form accuracy algorithms.
- **`contract.ts`**: Handles Avalanche blockchain interactions, including wallet connections and smart contract calls.
- **`ChainlinkEnhancement.tsx`**: Manages Chainlink Functions integration for AI analysis.
- **`Leaderboard.tsx`**: Displays the live, on-chain leaderboard.

### Exercise Detection Algorithm

The app uses trigonometric calculations on MediaPipe pose landmarks to determine torso angles for detecting sit-ups and crunches, calculating real-time form accuracy:

```typescript
// Key body points for abs exercises
const shoulders = average(leftShoulder, rightShoulder);
const hips = average(leftHip, rightHip);
const knees = average(leftKnee, rightKnee);

// Calculate torso angle
const angle = calculateAngle(shoulders, hips, knees);

// Exercise state logic
if (angle < 55¬∞) ‚Üí "up" position (crunch/sit-up top)
if (angle > 105¬∞) ‚Üí "down" position (lying flat)
```

## Journey: From Complex to Simple & Reliable

### What We Tried Initially ‚ùå

**Chainlink Functions for Weather API Integration**

- **Goal**: Use Chainlink Functions to fetch WeatherXM data for weather-enhanced scoring
- **Implementation**: Complex JavaScript source code calling external APIs
- **Problems Encountered**:
  - Source code size limits (~1000 characters) made meaningful integration impossible
  - High gas costs (570k+ gas) with frequent transaction failures
  - Complex debugging with unpredictable errors
  - WeatherXM API integration too large for Functions constraints
  - Cost vs. reliability didn't justify the complexity

**On-Chain AI Analysis Storage**

- **Goal**: Store full AI feedback text on-chain for user display
- **Problems**:
  - Extremely expensive (~20,000 gas per 32 bytes of text)
  - Chainlink Functions response size limits (~256 bytes)
  - Mixing concerns (contract should handle scoring, not UI content)
  - Not scalable or cost-effective

**Weight-Based Exercise Limitations**

- **Goal**: Use powerlifting databases for enhanced deadlift scoring
- **Fatal Flaw**: Webcam pose detection cannot verify actual weight
- **Problems**:
  - Users could claim 500lb deadlifts while lifting empty bar
  - No hardware integration for weight verification
  - Trust/verification impossible with webcam-only setup

### Breakthrough: Simplified Multi-Service Approach ‚úÖ

**From Complex Functions to Reliable Automation + VRF**

After hitting the limitations of Chainlink Functions, we pivoted to a much more effective approach:

**New Architecture**:

- **Chainlink Automation**: Handles periodic weather bonus updates (every 6 hours)
- **Chainlink VRF**: Generates provably fair daily fitness challenges
- **Chainlink CCIP**: Enables cross-chain fitness score synchronization
- **Smart Weather Bonuses**: Pre-configured seasonal and regional bonuses

**Why This Works Better**:

- ‚úÖ **Predictable gas costs** (200k-420k vs 570k+ failures)
- ‚úÖ **Reliable execution** (no complex API integrations to fail)
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Chainlink services** (showcases broader ecosystem)
- ‚úÖ **Production ready** (simple, testable, debuggable)

### Current Implementation ‚úÖ

**Weather-Enhanced Scoring System**:

- **Seasonal Bonuses**: Summer heat (8%), Winter cold (10%), etc.
- **Regional Bonuses**: North regions (8%), Tropical (6%), Desert (10%), Arctic (12%)
- **Automatic Updates**: Chainlink Automation refreshes bonuses every 6 hours
- **Real Enhancement**: 14-16% score boosts working in production

**Daily Challenge System**:

- **VRF-Generated Challenges**: Provably fair random challenges
- **Challenge Types**: Reps, Duration, Streak, Accuracy, Combo challenges
- **Dynamic Bonuses**: 110-200% score multipliers for challenge completion
- **24-Hour Cycles**: New challenges generated daily via Automation

**Cross-Chain Ready**:

- **CCIP Integration**: Ready for multi-chain fitness tracking
- **Standardized ABIs**: Consistent across Polygon, Base, Celo deployments
