- **Integration**: 100% Complete with Real AI Analysis

## üéØ Project Vision and Value Proposition

Imperfect Abs is a decentralized fitness application that leverages blockchain technology and AI to provide personalized workout analysis and verifiable fitness achievements. It addresses real fitness coaching needs by offering:

- **Personalized Fitness Guidance**: AI-driven feedback on workout form and performance.
- **Transparent Progress Tracking**: Blockchain-verified workout data.
- **Gamified Experience**: Competitive leaderboards and potential rewards.
- **Community-Driven Ecosystem**: Integration with other fitness apps in the Imperfect Fitness Ecosystem.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router for frontend development.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type-safe development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with a custom Bauhaus-Brutalist design system.
- **MediaPipe**: Google's ML solution for real-time pose detection.
- **Ethers.js**: For blockchain interactions.
- **Avalanche C-Chain**: Fast, low-cost blockchain for the leaderboard.
- **Chainlink Functions**: Decentralized off-chain computation for AI analysis.

### Key Components

- **`ImprovedWorkoutTracker.tsx`**: Main workout interface for camera integration, pose detection, and session management.
- **`pose-detection.ts`**: Core logic for MediaPipe integration, angle calculations, and form accuracy algorithms.
- **`contract.ts`**: Handles Avalanche blockchain interactions, including wallet connections and smart contract calls.
- **`ChainlinkEnhancement.tsx`**: Manages Chainlink Functions integration for AI analysis.
- **`Leaderboard.tsx`**: Displays the live, on-chain leaderboard.

### Exercise Detection Algorithm

The app uses trigonometric calculations on MediaPipe pose landmarks to determine torso angles for detecting sit-ups and crunches, calculating real-time form accuracy:

```typescript
// Key body points for abs exercises
const shoulders = average(leftShoulder, rightShoulder);
const hips = average(leftHip, rightHip);
const knees = average(leftKnee, rightKnee);

// Calculate torso angle
const angle = calculateAngle(shoulders, hips, knees);

// Exercise state logic
if (angle < 55¬∞) ‚Üí "up" position (crunch/sit-up top)
if (angle > 105¬∞) ‚Üí "down" position (lying flat)
```
